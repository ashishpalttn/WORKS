@Ashish Pal You should be able test/resolve this without having CA (Care Advance) setup on your system. There are sample messages for what CA would send to our CareEdge system.
Send all the below messages to your CareEdge HOS queue (like you would the Adam Akers messages).
This message can configure the barriers in your Admin service: 

setp 1 => send -> resources/messages/grady/BarrierConfig/Barriers.json
Step 2 => send visit

Step 3 => Add some sample barriers with these messages:
resources/messages/grady/Adam_Akers/11-DC-Barrier.json
resources/messages/grady/Adam_Akers/12-Physician-Barrier.json
resources/messages/grady/Adam_Akers/13-Physician-Barrier_update.json

 # Resolve Barrier
 Send a Barrier Json (11-DC-Barrier.json) with active false

   "barrier": {
        .
        .
      "escalatedOn": "",
      "active": false,
      "resolvedOn": "2025-02-05T04:24:50-04:00", // current time
    }
