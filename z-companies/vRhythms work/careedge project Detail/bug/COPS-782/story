Sorting of Available Beds Queue Appears to be Random

Edit Description
The description in COPS-142: Queue: Available Beds
CLOSED
 says:

Group by Open Beds then Closed Beds, then clean beds at the top of each group

Group within Unit Types by Clean beds first, then dirty beds

Looking at the queue, there doesnâ€™t seem to be any sort that I can figure out.
