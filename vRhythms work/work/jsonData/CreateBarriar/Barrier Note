@Ashish Pal You should be able test/resolve this without having CA (Care Advance) setup on your system. There are sample messages for what CA would send to our CareEdge system.
Send all the below messages to your CareEdge HOS queue (like you would the Adam Akers messages).
This message can configure the barriers in your Admin service: 

resources/messages/grady/BarrierConfig/Barriers.json

Add some sample barriers with these messages:
resources/messages/grady/Adam_Akers/11-DC-Barrier.json
resources/messages/grady/Adam_Akers/12-Physician-Barrier.json
resources/messages/grady/Adam_Akers/13-Physician-Barrier_update.json
After you have those barriers created, you can follow the rest of QAâ€™s steps to configure the display code in the Admin app. Likely, we are only showing the Display Name - need to show the Display Code if it is set.
